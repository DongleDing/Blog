      The most unfortunate thing happened today. My semester registration wasn't approved, despite the fact that I paid for the registration. 
      I've contacted my advisor, senior advisor and mailed the head of department. And I was told to go meet the Ad Desk tomorrow. Moments of stress.

      Usual talks with my PA would never be more peaceful than I anticipated. She is amazing!
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to my mind about the words my mom's uncle told in the car while on our way to attend our relative's wedding. 
      There are two types of people in the world, good people who turn bad, and vice versa. But there are some people who are neither of these. 
      And I suppose the "person" he was talking about was a woman next door of our house, who once knew her role as a wife of my mother's uncle (That uncle who was a Police Officer), now turned into someone ostracized.
      We call her moly. I was close to her till I was 11. She had a posessive mind, where she never wanted her husband to go and interact with his siblings, or with their children. And that envy and aggression turned her into someone who is hated by everyone in the neighbourhood, that at one point my grandmother came up with a claim that Moly wanted my mom dead. 
      Long story short, Moly is hated here, and in light of several lawsuits she filed against my grandmother and her in-laws 5 years back, an officer showed up and told the people in the case (both complainant and the defendant) to show up at the court at a certain date.

      Two more months to hit a milestone. But that's not the topic for now. I 
      want to write a movie, and I need some serious help with it. I do have several 
      packets of thoughts being intercepted in my mind every second I find myself in an odd but less 
      weird situation. And to write it down here would be difficult, as the thoughts are volatile, and I am very lazy to write it down here. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well what must stop me from being called a psychopath when I've just spent 16 hours straight watching the whole GTA5 walkthrough for the 3rd time?
      Would that help me with the damn idea for a movie, or am I really in need of a therapist? I've been told by people with experience that Malboro wouldn't really work, and so to think of the effects of going beyond that point of intrusion is imaginable.

    No CTF today, as I decided to watch a boring tamil film Jailer, right after I finished watching wolf of Wall Street. The only thing I have in my mind right now is to make a new webpage to review movies. I'll do the same to talk about football too. The only reason I am here in the movie theater is not to watch Jailer, but to blog about what's those I had to see in the famous dicaprio's movie. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the scenes that do induce questions in some audience, the movie was great, and the acting of LDC was peak. Perfect. I am a huge fan. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Jailer was too predictable, and apart from the predicatable action scenes, the story was good.

      So I have decided to walk away from this. No this is not a Post Nut Clarity because the previous blog was a real document of that day. Despite all these efforts
      to be normal, there are still challenges. I couldn't go out and watch movies now, because the people who I used to watch movies with, seems to be on a tight budget. So I need to come up 
      with something to make me feel involved. 
      <br>
      I tried to do some small CTF puzzles, one of which was mildy annoying that the level of its difficulty caused a great imapct in me that the reaction with tea and 3 Litres of Fizz drink in my stomach along with this codebreaking frustration caused me to dip and think of something else. 
      <br>
      The first challenge was simple. It was just to open a text file embedded within the webpage and all it took was a wget magic. Not sophisticated, and not difficult. 
      <br>
      However, the second challenge forced me to look at the hints, and the link embedded with the challenge pop-up of that webpage had more than one file. A python script to decode a ROT13 code to get the flag, and a separate text file with a password to the python script which was written in a bit64 format. 
      After a few sets of head scratching, I figured out that the password in the text file was not just had to be directly copied and pasted into the python script's execution interface, but that I had to initially use a set of side parameters while trying to execute the script, where you could use -d or -e, followed by the password text file name, to obtain again, a ROT13 ciphered code, which had to be decrypted to obtain the flag. 
      <br>
      Then there was another baffling challenge, to find the flag in a jpg file. It would've been grateful if the hint really specified what it meant when it said to look at the file properties, because that was the moment the physical pain and ambiguity I felt after an apparent intoxication of that drink reacting with the evening tea forced me to recline on to the couch while thinking what had to be done to decrypt the jpg file. Was it the next "Cicada" thing? I wondered.
      And then I saw someone posted on a subreddit about the same challege, where they said it was all about knowing the bit64 characters embedded in it when we use the exiftool and see the image properties. Decoding it finally gave me the flag. And then I stopped there. 
      <br>
      Now this time, the code embedded within the enc file is something written in Chinese, and even the translator couldn't understand what it was. Will look into it later, while I jump to the next puzzle. 
      <br>
      The title for this one is called as "Stonks". This time the script embedded in the popup is written in C and there is something I should be doing with netcat too. Done with it. I just realized that the file vuln.c actually seeks the user input for reading the stack by asking some API token. THe thing is that it generates some random set of values with the format <b>X shares of a certain value</b>; random in the sense that it keeps generating some different outputs like in this format even when I entered the same API token everytime I re execute the script. And I just realized I need to have an experience with a python script that uses pwn module. So I am done for today. Will be troubling my movie dealer (aka the clown that stole Nejuva from me) for the link to watch Inception.

So bored even during Onam. I wanted to pack up and LEAVE this damn place for 10 days. Exams were fine. The truce between me and my father continues. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I just witnessed a dystopic day today, in the campus. In most of those people dressed up for the festive celebrations with all the smiles, I saw darkness in them. I saw something odd. All the people that I used to hang out with, are now gone, made me feel like I am in a literal matrix. The amount of calls I made to my closest friends to ask their whereabouts in those crowds, and the amount of times some of them lied to me, while some didn't pick up, was unusual. 
      I wasn't able to fully take in the festive vibes, hoping to treat myself for being able to finish the first year, and it was all ended out, like as if I fell into a world filled with people that doesn't seem to care when I felt I was being isolated. This is what really happens when I find myself in the middle of a crowd, throwing themselves into the party vibes, when I won't be able to process about the fad that is now in the air. I saw people dancing with people they claim as something more than a friendship, and a few of them like me tried to mingle and vibe with them, knowing that there would still be some people who just couldn't take it in such a way to find those in desolation finding a bit of dopamine. I wonder whether if it was a kind of atmosphere created by my father, when I told him to go put a bullet in his head, when he screamed at me because I hung out with the brother of my dead mother, for a while. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've lived through a dystopian world before, but having not to expect a turntable to the things caused me to get blanked out all of a sudden. Thing is, I want to get my mind off it.
      Easy enough, except I need an idea.

    Things never seemed to get better for me. Had a shit day today. The paper today was just ridiculously difficult. I just need to seek some time alone. 
      Fizz bottles didn't help. Or even the old citalopram tablets I stole from my friend. I just find it diffcult to accept something I didn't wanted to accept.

      Life without wifi is awkward. I mean I am not being critical of the 'stoic' mindset, 
      though it actually have a lot of things I need to question about. The hostel situated at the 
      middle of a damn jungle feels like is a million mile away from the nearest mobile tower. So 
      the chances of me trying to cure my boredom by making edits to this webpage or trying to figure 
      out something about making a ping pong game I had mind my mind, would be bleak. Also it's really awkward when 
      you have such striking thoughts in the middle of an end semester exam, and not when you needed it. 
      So funny life really is. 
      <br>
      Done watching Amazing Spiderman. Too late to watch I know; but let me tell you, the casts and the story 
      were awesome, and the buildup to the story of connors screwing up the algorithm shown in Connors' Equation.
      But despite all these action thriller moments, the movie was too predictable. And as the year goes by, it's only when 
      I realize that the old action hero movies gets cringier and crigier. Something really needs to change. It sounds more common 
      when people really advocate by voicing their fandom for such movies. The direction of the movie can really be compared with one of the most awkward 
      movies in the DC franchise: Flash(2023) partly because of its odd cgi, despite having a fairly good story. DC seemed to be better when it comes to providing great stories, 
      and finding the perfect actors for it. But this might've been where I feel they drew the line. It was good when Joker and Dark Knight Trilogy 
      was a hype. Both went upto Oscar recognition, and they deserved it.

      So I decided to get rid of my boredom and hopelessness of not being 
      able to sneak into the library on a sunday by stress testing the server of the college webpage.
      A 20 rupees sting also helped me cope with the pain, as the cost of fizz bottles seemed
      skyrocketed. My only trepidation at present is the Mechanics and Civil Eng Basics. Or the world wasn't build for me to interact with Safa.
      <br>
      Btw new hostel doesn't seem 'that' boring despite the claustrophobic issue both in the room and the bathroom.
      I kinda hate when toilet and shower gets separated. And it's even terrifying to even think of the height of the door of one of the three toilet stalls. The ground clearance is so wide that someone can crawl into it, or even put a phone through it when someone uses his only chance to answer nature's call.

    <p>So bored that I don't even wanted to think of not thinking about something. Maybe I just go green with the intrusive approach? Should I release the thoughts? Should I risk a degree course?
    <br>Thinking of trashing the civil department, that hag has done it again. All she cared was for her salary and self esteem, and not my internal grades and the marks of the second internals. 15/25 is a pathetic score, and she wants to make it look even worse. 
    <br>And why does this look so horrendous, yet primitive to vent my thoughts through a crappy approach of using github repository edits rather than to use a separate private html page encrypted and fortified with a two factror authentication? knowing that i have barely or no touch in php, i fear giving a dime of my time thinking of doing something about it. I am lazy to even do this. </p>
