So bored even during Onam. I wanted to pack up and LEAVE this damn place for 10 days. Exams were fine. The truce between me and my father continues. 
    </p>

      I just witnessed a dystopic day today, in the campus. In most of those people dressed up for the festive celebrations with all the smiles, I saw darkness in them. I saw something odd. All the people that I used to hang out with, are now gone, made me feel like I am in a literal matrix. The amount of calls I made to my closest friends to ask their whereabouts in those crowds, and the amount of times some of them lied to me, while some didn't pick up, was unusual. 
      I wasn't able to fully take in the festive vibes, hoping to treat myself for being able to finish the first year, and it was all ended out, like as if I fell into a world filled with people that doesn't seem to care when I felt I was being isolated.

      Maybe stess testing a college webpage served by inmotionhosting would be less impactful. I must find some other alternative to do so.

    Things never seemed to get better for me. Had a shit day today. The paper today was just ridiculously difficult. I just need to seek some time alone. 
      Fizz bottles didn't help. Or even the old citalopram tablets I stole from my friend. I just find it diffcult to accept something I didn't wanted to accept.

      Life without wifi is awkward. I mean I am not being critical of the 'stoic' mindset, 
      though it actually have a lot of things I need to question about. The hostel situated at the 
      middle of a damn jungle feels like is a million mile away from the nearest mobile tower. So 
      the chances of me trying to cure my boredom by making edits to this webpage or trying to figure 
      out something about making a ping pong game I had mind my mind, would be bleak. Also it's really awkward when 
      you have such striking thoughts in the middle of an end semester exam, and not when you needed it. 
      So funny life really is. 
      <br>
      Done watching Amazing Spiderman. Too late to watch I know; but let me tell you, the casts and the story 
      were awesome, and the buildup to the story of connors screwing up the algorithm shown in Connors' Equation.
      But despite all these action thriller moments, the movie was too predictable. And as the year goes by, it's only when 
      I realize that the old action hero movies gets cringier and crigier. Something really needs to change. It sounds more common 
      when people really advocate by voicing their fandom for such movies. The direction of the movie can really be compared with one of the most awkward 
      movies in the DC franchise: Flash(2023) partly because of its odd cgi, despite having a fairly good story. DC seemed to be better when it comes to providing great stories, 
      and finding the perfect actors for it. But this might've been where I feel they drew the line. It was good when Joker and Dark Knight Trilogy 
      was a hype. Both went upto Oscar recognition, and they deserved it.

      So I decided to get rid of my boredom and hopelessness of not being 
      able to sneak into the library on a sunday by stress testing the server of the college webpage.
      A 20 rupees sting also helped me cope with the pain, as the cost of fizz bottles seemed
      skyrocketed. My only trepidation at present is the Mechanics and Civil Eng Basics. Or the world wasn't build for me to interact with Safa.

      Btw new hostel doesn't seem 'that' boring despite the claustrophobic issue both in the room and the bathroom.
      I kinda hate when toilet and shower gets separated. And it's even terrifying to even think of the height of the door of one of the three toilet stalls. The ground clearance is so wide that someone can crawl into it, or even put a phone through it when someone uses his only chance to answer nature's call.

    <p>So bored that I don't even wanted to think of not thinking about something. Maybe I just go green with the intrusive approach? Should I release the thoughts? Should I risk a degree course?
    <br>Thinking of trashing the civil department, that hag has done it again. All she cared was for her salary and self esteem, and not my internal grades and the marks of the second internals. 15/25 is a pathetic score, and she wants to make it look even worse. 
    <br>And why does this look so horrendous, yet primitive to vent my thoughts through a crappy approach of using github repository edits rather than to use a separate private html page encrypted and fortified with a two factror authentication? knowing that i have barely or no touch in php, i fear giving a dime of my time thinking of doing something about it. I am lazy to even do this. </p>

    <p>Aaand, the second sem comes to an end. No longer a fresher. Grappled well enough for a phase 1 redemption as a compensation for the first internals downfall. A few days of headstart gap to do more works here in the webpage.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's really the wrong time I decide to show up here in the library. The convulsion of people next to me makes me hit my head on the table and run sowewhere. I need to take a break. And what's worse is they badly want me to think of mandhi. And wearing headphones wouldn't be just enough.</p>-->

    <p>Maybe I just need to stop going to classes in rainy days. Can't go wet. This is absurd. Did the collector declare a holiday for us or for the rain?</p>

    <p>The most wet day today. My plans to get away from my inclination is dwindling away from me, carried away with the cold rain winds.</p>

    <p>I hate socializing. Perils of being with the old man is that there should be no objection to his interests when it comes to living with his influence by socializing with people I don't want to interact with. And thus, the delays in updating this webpage.</p>
    <hr size="3" width="100%" color="black">
    <h3>Jun 29, 2023|5:43 pm IST</h3>
    <p>This is the beginning. Maybe I need to add some more edits to this part. I get a lot of ideas like these and I don't know when and how would I find time to fill it.</p>
