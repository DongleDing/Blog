    <p>So bored that I don't even wanted to think of not thinking about something. Maybe I just go green with the intrusive approach? Should I release the thoughts? Should I risk a degree course? People here keeps bitching about me more often when I talked to vadarsh about girls. The girls in THIS house shall also be related to the girls of the CIVIL department.</p>

    <p>Aaand, the second sem comes to an end. No longer a fresher. Grappled well enough for a phase 1 redemption as a compensation for the first internals downfall. A few days of headstart gap to do more works here in the webpage.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's really the wrong time I decide to show up here in the library. The convulsion of people next to me makes me hit my head on the table and run sowewhere. I need to take a break. And what's worse is they badly want me to think of mandhi. And wearing headphones wouldn't be just enough.</p>-->

    <p>Maybe I just need to stop going to classes in rainy days. Can't go wet. This is absurd. Did the collector declare a holiday for us or for the rain?</p>

    <p>The most wet day today. My plans to get away from my inclination is dwindling away from me, carried away with the cold rain winds.</p>

    <p>I hate socializing. Perils of being with the old man is that there should be no objection to his interests when it comes to living with his influence by socializing with people I don't want to interact with. And thus, the delays in updating this webpage.</p>

    <p>This is the beginning. Maybe I need to add some more edits to this part. I get a lot of ideas like these and I don't know when and how would I find time to fill it.</p>
