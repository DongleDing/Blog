    <p>
      So the new semester has started, and things are just the same; but a slight increase in awareness of why I chose this path of my life. The advisor sugessted to 
      do certification courses along with the regular classes. New faculties are boring. They aren't any close to those in the 3rd sem. The old prof I got pissed by in 
      sem 1 came back to us to teach manufacturing process. I decided to get hold on to my own grips for now; seeing the professors I got to see this sem. Life is shit and 
      bleak, and colourless as always. I just realized there is no one here in this world I could call out and seek help for. Never was I able to go out and see the beach 
      during the sem break. Every passing day gets me closer to that thought of ending it all on the railway track in front of the campus. Vapi has literally made his stance 
      to stay away from me until I spend time in the gym when he doesn't realize that I am being strangled by this semester. The world has shut their doors, and I am in utter 
      darkness. I see darkness even when it's a broad daytime, in room M404 with ~65 other mortals around me. They somehow find someone to share laughter and talk to, and that 
      is the only thing in my entire life I have ever failed to be like. It's getting worse; worse and worse. And I am simply sinking into my own oblivion. My only fear now 
      is my will to live. For some reason, I couldn't get rid of something in me that wants me to end myself. The only thing I am barely fortunate for is that I get to write 
      all these here, and rather not say this to anyone; not even Sameha. Everything around me is quickly losing colour, and my wish to quietly weep somewhere secluded is fading too. 
      I tried to walk through railway tracks, and all I see is couples holding hands together, spending their "quality time".</br> 
      Life as a whole sucks. My perspective of happiness has 
      really became materialized. Now they are memes and cats; flowers, sunrise and sets. My thoughts and dreams quickly shrunk into one small wooden house, placed between meadows and
      gardens, facing mountains with ice caps, and cherry blossom trees; beneath one of which I just want to sit down and admire the beauty of the river that flows past me, surrounding me 
      would be no humans but a bunch of cats. And in the evening the house lit with warm ambient lamps, sounds of birds chirping, the river flowing, leaves rustling, cool and calm winds blowing; washing 
      away all the pain, and tears that never fell from my eyes due to the intense pressure of being stoic in this cold place.. all of the pain, that was inflicted by the words and actions of 
      all my classmates, "loved" ones I am forced to live with, scars caused by life's shackles, and the truth that I am never going to see beauty in life ever again.. all just going to 
    be nothing but plain remniscents I could laugh and smile at.. all those small miniscule good times I could ever remember of..  knowing that I never wanted life to be this painful, though it had to be that way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple meadow in which I will never be found; will never be cared about (like it has always been, but in a good way most certainly); will never be approched by Aromal and Aparna to 
      be questioned about my citizenship in the country I was born into, the country I wanted to be utopic; will never be noticed by Ajayakumar over his concern regarding his software issues; will 
      never be approached by people that seeks for donation and support for their crappy college programs, will never be approached by some sick bastards in hostels that seek daily for nothing but plates to fill their stomach; 
      will never be noticed or informed by the news of the dying world and its humanity; will never be approached by Mohith, whose interest in inclining onto my source of comfort (sitting on my study chair and staring at his own segment of his usual comfort (his phone); having to witness his terrible admiration for cringe bollywood lores, his love life.. etc.,) really gets into my nerves; will never be approached by my diabetic step grandmother who used to walk three times into my room everyday, holding my meal;
      will never be approched by a phone that receives video and voice call notifications from Vapi, Pachi and whoever the fuck that wanted me to exist just for some mysterious sake. I've learnt all the "mysteries", and all it can unfold is nothingness. 
    </p>
    <p>
      fuck this place. fuck this world. thanks that i had to live the harsh way. thanks to meta for making me see dead children in the streets in Gaza, and making me feel sad about my day. Thanks for the media source that 
      wants me to know bulldozers and sanghis are gonna get me, and that pinarayi starts to literally be in his harvey-dent-to-two-faced transition phase. A part of me wants to fly an SR71 Blackbird all alone, as high as I can, as fast as I can; so distant from people that I never 
      want to feel sadness ever again. Clouds are soothing, they resemble tranquility, conveys something that marks an end to all pain.

      On a chat with Kevin, I wrote:
      "Mankind has surely have evolved with merely or no sense of empathy. We are born blind into this world, and sadly most of us choose to live that way. 
      And to seek to live as the otherwise would be an act of a fugitive from the eyes of the bureaucracy that desires to strengthen their twines on our puppet hands;
      failure of which would only lead them to send to us the gift of liquidation. A person that never chooses to lead a life of order is indeed the terror and fear to the eyes of bureaucracy,
      and indeed to the eyes of the apparent blinded minds among whom he/she chose to live. They are not known, but assumed. And known assumptions grow into conspiracies, which produce nothing but
      curiosity and the lust for the answers. The curious mind never rests, and thus lives the rest of the life in dismay and utter discomfort. If there would be 
      a group of people that live that way, then they are the ones we chose to call as the fugitives or renegades; which some of them whose blinded eyes were luminated with
      facts will then call them "whistleblowers". "</br>
      It has always been the desire of the whistleblower to be believed so that in the end the state of mankind will never had to be the way it would had it never been intervened by him. 
      However, the real challenge exists, when we realize we are living in a world where the authenticity of a notion to be belived as a fact are determined by the booleans: True or False. 
      And the hard part is to make people believe. </br>
    We certainly are doomed. Forget the generation, it was always destined to be doomed. The world of colours and joy
    will exist only in the mere memories of ours. We care to emphasize on something that gives us the materialistic satisfaction, 
    not a moral or spiritual one. It has and had been mine ultimate interest to distance from the rough world that contains everyone that was 
    cursed with responsibilities to care about me, and people that I feel wouldn't stand well on their feet when I am around them. I've been 
    asked by people who see my artwork about my color theme selection for most of my drawings. I find it hard to gather the right words and 
    convey what's inside my head for a better answer. But I guess that's the way I see the world, or maybe I was forced to see it that way. 
    A world where one's struggle has been imposed on to someone else just because they probably are related to them. I saw the world in black and 
    white, where people around me are nothing but bots programmed with emotions that must be expressed to pretend sanity. I've been used often for 
    their benefits, and I was hoped not to expect acknowledgement from them. I've often walked around like the soul of a dead body, something people 
    definitely cannot perceive. When the pressure to interact with them becomes intense, I choose to do anything to get their attention and fulfill the 
    deed, in hopes that I will never have to "resurrect" my carcass for them ever again. I really craved for some time off from the people I usually am forced to meet and 
    talk with, because all I want to let them know is that I have a mind which is incorrigible, and structured in a way they never know. And I have succumbed to their 
    ignorance which can only be expressed in terms of the counts of fuckery. I guess my moment to cherish solitude will only be felt if I ever get a chance to leave this mortal 
    world. Death and darkness were the few things I was afraid of a decade back. Now I would hope that if I ever get a chance to travel back and meet that optimistic version of 
    myself, I would want him to be convinced of the fact that such entities we fear are something meant to give us tranquility; because what we need to fear and endure will be this 
    hard harsh world we were brought into. Darkness must be allied. Darkness has much of peace than light, because light resembles chaos. Light was only meant to be seen as a 
    symbol of hope, but the true meaning is something much deeper than that.

      A few terrible things seemed to happen. Jurgen is leaving liverpool, and I do not know how to react. And so is the whole of the coaching board that literally uplifted my 
      whole life out of nothing. They have no idea how much impact they had on my life, when I was in the worst phase of my life. They literally gave a whole new meaning for 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ll_Never_Walk_Alone">the club motto</a>. The song is the one that too played a crucial part in giving myself a second chance to 
      live and resurrect from the 2017 trauma. I would never know who all are the people that are going to leave in the coming days, but I am prepared. I have convinced myself that 
      good people come and go. That's probably the best I can ever do. I still would be a fan of liverpool, and Jurgen. Good things have happened, and now probably in the phase of 
      rough roads to an even beautiful destination.

      Watched Cars and Drive in the span of 2 days. Thinking of trying out some new movies rather than to keep urging myself to watch blade runner for the nth time. Minecraft seems to be boring

      Had my practical exams today. It was Material Testing. Wack. Despite the fact that I did all the things that 
      was supposed to be written in the paper better, I fucked up viva. Got a straight 10 minute firing session from vapi on phone 
      after the exam, over the viva. And, for the first time in 4 years, I finally cried. I decided not to strike back, and hear it 
      all from him, and get forcefully admit that I suck. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It sucks to be so lonely that I literally have no one to seek help from when it comes to academics. I wonder how long would 
      I even pretend to laugh and care in this bullcrap life I ended up living and ruining. I am just alone. I literally can no longer 
      feel any difference when I am in a class full of students, and me being in an empty class. The guys no longer hang out, and I no longer want to 
      be a part of them. All what every people in my class wanted from me was my hospitality, and they ditch me like a chocolate wrapper once I give them 
      what they wanted from me. All what vapi said that even made me question my point of existence really was true. I even doubt about getting placed. 
      I am slowly considering to make full use of my driving license I got, so I can seek something serene when I fully twist down that handle of that shitbox 100cc motorcycle in NH66, that still gathers dust 
      in mom's garage vapi intentionally never wanted to care for just because he knew what I was going to be doing with it. He can keep telling Pachi what a dork I am 
      because I keep updating him about my academics. He can keep pretending as if he cares, because he makes the money. He can keep telling I am not pursuing my passion, because all he did was 
      to be a hinderance when that passion involves money. 
    </p>

      I don't know if I have finally reached my Paul Walker arc. And whatever that it would be, I am pretty sure I will never live to see 30. I am totally fine with it. To live is what fears me, and I can't risk it anymore.

      Watched a movie today. It's a Malayalam Film "Neru" (Truth). The direction is goated, and I liked it. I often find that Jithu Joseph
      really hates to put himself in the audience perspective, and empathize with them. Adding depths to a mixture of anger,
      sadness, vindiction all into one scene is something this guy really can pull off.

      Hello there!<br>
      Been a while since we met. You and I have missed a lot of things in a span of three weeks. The fact that it was already three weeks since the last time 
      I ever made an entry here was shown by my repository itself. Time goes by real quick, and I still find it a challenge to catch up with. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been certain instances in which I acted accordingly to the fact that time is the only one I am supposed to be livid with, and not the people that get into 
      my nerves. Apart from the pink in academics, there is another thrive for a possibility in finding a soulmate. I might jump into a really terrible decision, but 
      Sameha has been the only person ever to spend her free time for me, asking all kinds of questions regarding my updates and wellbeings. The challenge comes in 
      when she goes away for her NEET coaching preparations, and I have a strong feeling that I shouldn't intervene. But all the time I get to chat with her, it really 
      is a form of stress relief. I found my way out of sheer isolation when I realized I could be able to get with her, and toss all my thoughts to her, even when she is not around.
      It's like Vapi in his office opening mails from Aramco execs and replying to them one by one. It was all well when she was around and wasn't off for her entrance coaching classes. 
      Now that I'd have to wait for her to get back, I had to struggle slightly, and I did not like this progress. It must be clean, and I must have no ambiguities about that. Yes, good side is there is a progress, 
      but a one free to enjoy is well-deservingly cherishable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I met her when I was in my class 10 math tuition in KSA, despite the fact that we met, we didn't speak with each other, and the black lady (tuition teacher, she coined her own nickname, and is used to it) had to leave to UAE during the 
      initial covid wave. Before we met in person in the bowling alley party hosted by our mutual friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qusai.dahodwalla/">(my friend, a Canadian goose enduring in Calgary)</a> in a compound club near Khobar Seafront, we used to talk in VC (yes, VC), and 
      it wasn't that casual or intimate; until one day she started to care about my periodic absence from the gc. I would surely fight my way over the fact that there was only one person who cared to ask my state of mind in an environment filled with 
      nothing but a bunch of NPCs that included all my classmates and people I meet in person everyday. I have decided to be more close to spirituality, because it did help me at some points. (I am NOT lying)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when I said about my dreams in <a href ="#1">this entry</a>, I said I would choose to live in the end in both scenarios as still single and lonely, only after I 
      found a soulmate, and experience more joy and heartbreaks (I probably couldn't endure more, because I had already been through one in 2017); and thus it's after then when the set I 
      typed in that must entry must come in play. Speaking of which, my sister somehow decided to dig through my entries in this blogpage one day, and gave the most blenching remark I've ever heard from her, 
      (most of which of her remarks usually were, but this one was the peak). She said that in the scenario in which I would be feeding birds in a park in an old age home where I would be sent to, she would bother me by 
      scratching her butt and disrupting my only part of my life's timeline to cherish peace and an isolation in its best form, because she would also want to see herself in the same old age home I would die at. Too unwanting that it would badly force me to ask Sameha for her dad's number and 
      go forward with the wedding once I land a job in my course-core company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will be really off in the coming weeks, even during the Christmas. I got a big event coming up in the month of January, and I want to make the best out of it. Also I got to pick my license card from my cousin. My will to live must be balanced with that one permit issued to me by the Government.

      Today, I made another milestone. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed the Driving License Test. Was a bit nervous, but then I realized the only few things they (the old MVD dudes who look pissed) noticed weren't the one I anticipated, 
      and I don't know what that it is. Anyway, might get the card hopefully next week. And I was scared, because I really know people in Kollam, they are literally the Ohio in Kerala.

  I turned 20 2 days ago. 20 years round the sun, 20 years of a journey filled with Joy and pain. I made it anyways. Grateful. 
    </p>
<p>
And my campus has finally overthrown an establishment that seemed to had sought relevance through their centralised mindset that only made the quality of this college derailed. Wouldn't that be really better if the students rule with no political mindset used in as their element of influence rather? wouldn't that be better if we try to maintain things in such a way that the student union never stands constantly for causing oppression? Wouldn't that be better to convince someone that to produce a factor of oppression and then protest on it doesn't really serve the purpose and demand of the students?

      A week long exam was over yesterday, so I had to stay away for a while. Plenty of things happening around the world. Children dying everyday, which is indeed saddening.

    The government provides us university students an absolute hoorendous website. Transactions are not possible via that webpage. The urge that made me say this is because 
    We've been asked to pay our semester fee through their website. Despite having great software engineers in this country, the government did not consider the importance
    having a website maintained well. I am doomed if I am not able to make payment by tonight.

      We have a holiday today. There was something bizzare that happened last night in our glorified campus. Just a little punch between two party elites 
      lead a team of police forces (probably a SWAT equivalent) to blockade our campus frontgate and walk up and down the parking lot. There were students crowded and
      something was not going well. And I noticed this on my way back from prayer at a  mosque nearby. Two or three police buses with forces surrounding outside the campus 
      really made me ask a few questions to people nearby, and they said the exact thing what I thought it would be. I was told this is something too normal for a college in 
      kerala where college unions are a huge topic. The altercations were between a party I do not like, and a party I don't know much about. So apart from the whole scenario, the 
      element of conflict didn't bother me at all. Something weird will happen this week, following the elections. I came to know that someone tore the nomiation paper, and 
      violated a few election rules put forward by the University. A few students were summoned by the college to justify their acts. It was today morning when I got to see the reason why 
      the SWATs had to intervene. One guy got jumped, and all the other guys from either sides were making an attempt to brawl because of what happened to him, 
      despite seeing a few people trying to hold them back.

      The exams were postponed. Not surprising, as I saw it coming from miles away. The college 
      must give spaces when a thing called student union elections take place. And it has always 
      been the same party that kept winning. Another reason why I find this campus boring and 
      dystopic. And the exams are scheduled on the day of my driving test. So to either prepone it or 
      reschedule it after the exams would be the only option I would have; and for that, I would 
      have to make a reluctant journey to the Regional Transport Office. I must seek someone to accompany.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just find it bit hurting, when someone you had a good friendly impression for; ostracises you real quick.
      It would be a fun for A****l and A****a to do such, as they know I could do nothing about it.
      I don't feel like gaining any hopes, when all I do is wake up and leave for the classes, and sit there listening to 
      the lectures when the professors take their hours. And when they're not, I would be able to see and feel a huge boundary between me and other 71 
      students. All of them would find someone to share their thoughts with, and find joy in it, share laughter; and at the end of the day, they would go home with someone 
      they could talk with. And I would find myself stranded with no one but me. And I would just simply walk back to my hostel room the same way I walked to the classes: 
      with a feel of dejection and desolation. I am pretty sure it's not a complete loneliness that forces me to be sad; but the feel of being lonely even when you actually found 
      someone to talk and fuck around with. Kevin couldn't show up all the time, and my sister reluctantly permits me to send my thoughts to her in text chats, though she does not 
      read any of them most of the time. She is a caring person, so caring that I had a feel of regret when I didn't find any way to help her with her problems. I asked my father about 
      seeking a medication for such (being aware of the risks) by meeting a clinical psychiatrists nearby. He did gave approval. The old therapists never did cause any change in me, because all they 
      did was to come to a shitty conclusion from a conjecture. Aromal did pretend to care by frequently asking about the unstable relationship between me and my father, yet all he chose 
      to be at the end of the day was being acquisitive, despite all the times I took him and A****a out for some drinks or to dine somewhere. The same stance was what I saw in her too. And I am 
      pretty convinced about the fact that I am a subject of ostracization for them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I would wish to do the first few things right after I get my driving license. To give use of an old TVS Centra in our house's car porch. 
      The only few people I remember who used it was my grandfather (until he died back in 2015), my uncle and my father: if they are here for their vacations.
      I've rode the bike too, inside the compound. My use for the bike was restricted only within the family compound, which was big enough to
      simply give a test ride for smaller RPMs and lower gears. I would like to take it and go somewhere far, just to clear my head off. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday, I reluctantly sat down and listened to Mohith's approach towards his feeling for all the women who possibly ditched him. And this forced me to stay awake till the morning, 
      and learn a part in Fluid Mechanics that had something to do with an assignment that is supposed to be turned in tomorrow. I am pretty sure why his sister wouldn't want to intervene and care for his 
      emotions, when all he does is to give beyond-borderline care and affection to people he thinks is nice from his perspective. And such an obsession to be more communicative with girls forced him to lose a 
      good chance of doing something good with his life. I am not against the idea of having a healthy friendship with people of the opposite sex. I learned its importance right after I joined this campus. 
      Because when that became the first time I felt I literally was in a co-ed environment, I had to quickly think of blending my mind and personality with this little world, partly because of which 
      I possibly had to endure with a kind of loneliness I wouldn't want to have. I wouldn't want to say no to Mohith for expressing his thoughts, even when I know that isn't really his actual problem. I kept listening to him, 
      and had to frequently remind him about a fact that I am not exactly a connoisseur when it comes to relationships. Adding with a little friendly rejectable advices, I eventually made attempts to get off the strings.

      I might be the first person in my campus to ever get rejected in a club interview. I saw the linedin profile of the person who called me for the interview, 
      and I don't know how to react. She looks more professional than me. I need to learn a lot from her, and we both are of the same age. This is an embarassment for me.

      The day today was mid. Not bad. However, I got a bunch of serious works to do, because the next week, I must witness the first examination paper of the second year.
      Detrimental. Also a very canon event fr. Had a business meeting with Kevin too, after the class. Very interesting therapy session. I liked it. Only if I had a huge budget 
      would I then be able to go for such business meeting in a restaurant nearby with kevin, EVERYDAY.

      I just want to be happy. And what should happiness mean to me? Some people personify thoughts that
      make them happy, while some materialize happiness. For me, it's a mix of both of these.Sometimes, I simply want 
      good times to come back, or I must have an apparent feel of something similar incase the fate wouldn't be that exact.
      And if I get a life that I previously desired, which is to be rich and powerful, I wouldn't really know what to 
      do with all the wealth I gathered. I still really don't know what my heart desires. But I am sure about one thing.
      It's always the simple things I need to be happy at the barest. So I stick with simple things if I make it in the 
      end. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to be alone. As I used to be. It was sad and frightening for me at the beginning. But reality of it 
      slowly unfolded as I lived in isolation. It actually saved me from people I don't like. But also from the people 
      I do like. Though not completely, it helped me know what I need. Being alone really helped me understand why either 
      being extreme isolated or extreme contacted by the people I meet everyday would make me happy, while feeling lonely 
      when still people I meet everyday interacts with me really pisses me off. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to cry. Funny for having such a wish, because the last time I cried was 4 years back. And since then I 
      was wondering why I didn't cry through all these years when I still had tough days through most of this timeline. 
      Also I forgot how to. The real pain is when you're not able to cry. Because being dead inside is more challenging 
      than simply being dead. Death as I know is a gateway to tranquility. Should I count on it would be something debatable 
      for my moral and immoral side. I relied on morality in the form of religion for years, and I still didn't lost any 
      grip at it. So I am on a point of ambiguity regarding this. I assure you, this natural ability of a typical human
      wouldn't come back to me even when something happens to someone I must care about. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If that ambiguity still dwell in my mind, then I would have two approches to the setting of my life's
      movie at the end of its timeline:<br>
      The first one would be me at an old age home. I still haven't clearly had a firm belief on a fact that life would 
      be complete when you are able to start a family and have something to feed you and them for a long time. But in several cases, 
      it only will be a responsibility that ends up being a great burden. And when it is a burden, there is a great possibility that 
      the family you have would be reaching a certain inevitable point where ostracizing you would be their only choice for their 
      life through endurance. To have a brave thought of facing it sounds good, but not practically. 
      So when I reach a point in my life where I have no one to finally worry about, I can be sent to an old aged home. 
      Hence I would be free of duties. Now I can be given simple auxillary duties I made for myself: Taking care of myself as much as I can, 
      and to feed pigeons and pet ducks in a small garden. The nurses shall do their work, but they still must respect my space. 
      <br>
      Now to the second approach. Me in a small house next to a seashore, in a beach cliff. I still want a pet duck. And I need a
      cruiser motorcycle. I don't want neighbors. I still can have this laptop, or other gadgets. Depends on the innovation I might 
      see when I make it there. Need no wife or maids. A small house has easy access to everything needed, and is easy to clean. 
      I can learn how to cook anything that suffice me. And a good view of the sea and the horizon is a must, as I can simply feel happy with 
      watching a sea. I can have free thought when I am finally free. Maybe I can write about it here one day.

      I am not sure about whether there would be any classes right after 
      workshop today, and if's not the case, I must think about getting back with the CTF 
      games I used to do before. Not knowing the difficulty of it as I passed throiugh every 
      levels, I must take risk of wasting a good amount of time for this. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a day that almost brought me back to that "second thought".A few sets of second-hand embarassment due to some consecutive 
      clumsiness from my part exposed by my beloved advisors, which made me an unexpected laughing stock for a few students today. 
      Not sure, but the days that lead will be more testing for me. I might even have to finish writing the will note, and do the prompts 
      to open the letter as <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/binth_hashim24/">she</a> logs in to this laptop, when the day arrives. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And I also had an almost "peaceful" rainwalk today. Almost, because some NPC who once mocked me for living a moment in hestia techfest
      noticed me, and I had to wave and keep walking. After a disastrous badminton session, I realized why the weather today suits my current state of mind. 
      I need to reinforce my mind and heart well enough to withstand potential embarassing events that might come up tomorrow. Staffs here got very unpredictable 
      these days, and I don't know whether to like it or not. I found a few interesting things beside the attempt to cry in the rain: that when I wasn't able to 
      use my phone's flashlight (wet hands). Because I found out I had to create a light in my mind, and use it to guide myself through the darkness.

      I don't know what is going on. The professors are either busy with 
      the pre-sem paper evaluations, or busy inducting new freshman students
      joined this sem. Because they haven't gone into the core concepts of 
      the subjects they teach, and it's been a week since the new semester 
      started. And we might have apparently half a day off today.

      Also I went to watch a movie with the boys yesterday. It's SRK's Jawan. 
      Let me tell you: It's bollywood; so everything is basically predictable,
      and I do not like it. All what the people wants in the movie is the action 
      thrillers and dramatic entry of the stars in the movie. Story was good; just 
      the direction; that looks like was done by someone so hyped after watching 
      Chotta Bheem. This time, a considerably greater part of the audience 
      shared the same opinion I had in my mind; A blend of recent blockbuster movies that can even potentially be the next box office bomb. 
      Cinematography was fine, and props to that despite all these exaggerations that the
      usual bollywood hyperbolizes. A perfect actor must be able to create a vaccum of emotion
      in the viewer's heart, and must be able to fill that void with a new set of emotions, be it mixed or sorted.
      But it must bring in the emotional control in such a way that the viewer must have a scenario in his mind 
      as if he was that character in the movie, and this assumption must be stuck in him for a very long time.

      Been away for a while. I was not busy at all. Just trying to 
      be happy in being alone. I couldn't smile despite the fact that I went to play 
      badminton yesterday and day before. I tried reading some books I bought for the semester, 
      and still I couldn't bring my mind to it. I can't focus. Something's totally wrong with me. And I wanted 
      Kevin to take me to pool and Cinemas, and he didn't, because the rest of the other boys 
      went home. I was just spending my day eating regular 
      hostel meals, watching youtube, and sleeping. I am so alone, and it's funny that people 
      really wanted to ignore me. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much blog records of me being alone. I'm not sure if I am supposed to be sad or be 
      happy about it. Was it all the delusions caused by pity I had in my mind when I see campus couples, where
      people I know are seemed to be either in love, or have someone to join the company of walking 
      somewhere? Or was it that I just feel awkward when people surround me? Pretty sure I wouldn't feel 
      that awkwardness when people gather around me during my funeral. Reels in Instagram started to get
      boring, as I scrolled miles down, and tried to laugh at all memes. I just wanted to be like everyone 
      else, where I didn't felt like I was a geek, and I wanted to have some friends. Or sometimes, I 
      feel I don't want friends. I need someone to be more open to. Sometimes, I feel all these thoughts 
      are because it's been a while since I last lifted a dumbbell. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware of the fact that only a few (if by chance) would notice all these entries in this

      At least.

Back to the even more dystopic world I just lived. I realized its not money that I need, just a really small cabin-like house next to a seashore, with me and my bed and my laptop, with an infinite supply of fizz drinks and French fries. With a cat and a horse. Me alone, like I usually used to be.
    </p>

I will be living through days of despair and endurance. A time that tests me mentally and physically. I am convinced that there is more for me to do to be a man. My pain is constant. I will get myself together and hope for good times to return.

  Apart from today's good news that I was finally able to rectify the Sem registration issue, 
  there was certain people I found mildly annoying, apart from the senior advisor. It was now 
  a dude who teaches us a subject called Design and Engineering. Seems like he wanted an austere 
  environment, and he almost tried his best to terrify all of us with his English vocabulary that 
  for him sounded like a jargon. When he asked us to design whatever that thing we had in our mind, 
  he didn't provide us with a discretion to draw by adhering with the things I learnt about 
  engineering graphics in the first sem. And despite the fact that I drew a fighter jet that 
  disastrously looked like an F22 Raptor, and that too without a proper plan, elevation and a side view, 
  he seemed to be satisfied when he gave me his epic "suggestion" by telling this is not a school drawing and he said 
  some other things I don't really remember because all that was in my mind when he kept saying all those things 
  while all the other students glued their eyes on me, was the frustation I had to face at that moment 
  because I was just disappointed about not being able to fully decipher his character.

      It came to my mind about the words my mom's uncle told in the car while on our way to attend our relative's wedding. 
      There are two types of people in the world, good people who turn bad, and vice versa. But there are some people who are neither of these. 
      And I suppose the "person" he was talking about was a woman next door of our house, who once knew her role as a wife of my mother's uncle (That uncle who was a Police Officer), now turned into someone ostracized.
      We call her moly. I was close to her till I was 11. She had a posessive mind, where she never wanted her husband to go and interact with his siblings, or with their children. And that envy and aggression turned her into someone who is hated by everyone in the neighbourhood, that at one point my grandmother came up with a claim that Moly wanted my mom dead. 
      Long story short, Moly is hated here, and in light of several lawsuits she filed against my grandmother and her in-laws 5 years back, an officer showed up and told the people in the case (both complainant and the defendant) to show up at the court at a certain date.

    No CTF today, as I decided to watch a boring tamil film Jailer, right after I finished watching wolf of Wall Street. The only thing I have in my mind right now is to make a new webpage to review movies. I'll do the same to talk about football too. The only reason I am here in the movie theater is not to watch Jailer, but to blog about what's those I had to see in the famous dicaprio's movie. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the scenes that do induce questions in some audience, the movie was great, and the acting of LDC was peak. Perfect. I am a huge fan. 
    </p>

      Well, Jailer was too predictable, and apart from the predicatable action scenes, the story was good.

      So I have decided to walk away from this. No this is not a Post Nut Clarity because the previous blog was a real document of that day. Despite all these efforts
      to be normal, there are still challenges. I couldn't go out and watch movies now, because the people who I used to watch movies with, seems to be on a tight budget. So I need to come up 
      with something to make me feel involved. 
      <br>
      I tried to do some small CTF puzzles, one of which was mildy annoying that the level of its difficulty caused a great imapct in me that the reaction with tea and 3 Litres of Fizz drink in my stomach along with this codebreaking frustration caused me to dip and think of something else. 
      <br>
      The first challenge was simple. It was just to open a text file embedded within the webpage and all it took was a wget magic. Not sophisticated, and not difficult. 
      <br>
      However, the second challenge forced me to look at the hints, and the link embedded with the challenge pop-up of that webpage had more than one file. A python script to decode a ROT13 code to get the flag, and a separate text file with a password to the python script which was written in a bit64 format. 
      After a few sets of head scratching, I figured out that the password in the text file was not just had to be directly copied and pasted into the python script's execution interface, but that I had to initially use a set of side parameters while trying to execute the script, where you could use -d or -e, followed by the password text file name, to obtain again, a ROT13 ciphered code, which had to be decrypted to obtain the flag. 
      <br>
      Then there was another baffling challenge, to find the flag in a jpg file. It would've been grateful if the hint really specified what it meant when it said to look at the file properties, because that was the moment the physical pain and ambiguity I felt after an apparent intoxication of that drink reacting with the evening tea forced me to recline on to the couch while thinking what had to be done to decrypt the jpg file. Was it the next "Cicada" thing? I wondered.
      And then I saw someone posted on a subreddit about the same challege, where they said it was all about knowing the bit64 characters embedded in it when we use the exiftool and see the image properties. Decoding it finally gave me the flag. And then I stopped there. 
      <br>
      Now this time, the code embedded within the enc file is something written in Chinese, and even the translator couldn't understand what it was. Will look into it later, while I jump to the next puzzle. 
      <br>
      The title for this one is called as "Stonks". This time the script embedded in the popup is written in C and there is something I should be doing with netcat too. Done with it. I just realized that the file vuln.c actually seeks the user input for reading the stack by asking some API token. THe thing is that it generates some random set of values with the format <b>X shares of a certain value</b>; random in the sense that it keeps generating some different outputs like in this format even when I entered the same API token everytime I re execute the script. And I just realized I need to have an experience with a python script that uses pwn module. So I am done for today. Will be troubling my movie dealer (aka the clown that stole Nejuva from me) for the link to watch Inception.

So bored even during Onam. I wanted to pack up and LEAVE this damn place for 10 days. Exams were fine. The truce between me and my father continues. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I just witnessed a dystopic day today, in the campus. In most of those people dressed up for the festive celebrations with all the smiles, I saw darkness in them. I saw something odd. All the people that I used to hang out with, are now gone, made me feel like I am in a literal matrix. The amount of calls I made to my closest friends to ask their whereabouts in those crowds, and the amount of times some of them lied to me, while some didn't pick up, was unusual. 
      I wasn't able to fully take in the festive vibes, hoping to treat myself for being able to finish the first year, and it was all ended out, like as if I fell into a world filled with people that doesn't seem to care when I felt I was being isolated. This is what really happens when I find myself in the middle of a crowd, throwing themselves into the party vibes, when I won't be able to process about the fad that is now in the air. I saw people dancing with people they claim as something more than a friendship, and a few of them like me tried to mingle and vibe with them, knowing that there would still be some people who just couldn't take it in such a way to find those in desolation finding a bit of dopamine. I wonder whether if it was a kind of atmosphere created by my father, when I told him to go put a bullet in his head, when he screamed at me because I hung out with the brother of my dead mother, for a while. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've lived through a dystopian world before, but having not to expect a turntable to the things caused me to get blanked out all of a sudden. Thing is, I want to get my mind off it.
      Easy enough, except I need an idea.

      Life without wifi is awkward. I mean I am not being critical of the 'stoic' mindset, 
      though it actually have a lot of things I need to question about. The hostel situated at the 
      middle of a damn jungle feels like is a million mile away from the nearest mobile tower. So 
      the chances of me trying to cure my boredom by making edits to this webpage or trying to figure 
      out something about making a ping pong game I had mind my mind, would be bleak. Also it's really awkward when 
      you have such striking thoughts in the middle of an end semester exam, and not when you needed it. 
      So funny life really is. 
      <br>
      Done watching Amazing Spiderman. Too late to watch I know; but let me tell you, the casts and the story 
      were awesome, and the buildup to the story of connors screwing up the algorithm shown in Connors' Equation.
      But despite all these action thriller moments, the movie was too predictable. And as the year goes by, it's only when 
      I realize that the old action hero movies gets cringier and crigier. Something really needs to change. It sounds more common 
      when people really advocate by voicing their fandom for such movies. The direction of the movie can really be compared with one of the most awkward 
      movies in the DC franchise: Flash(2023) partly because of its odd cgi, despite having a fairly good story. DC seemed to be better when it comes to providing great stories, 
      and finding the perfect actors for it. But this might've been where I feel they drew the line. It was good when Joker and Dark Knight Trilogy 
      was a hype. Both went upto Oscar recognition, and they deserved it.

      A 20 rupees sting also helped me cope with the pain, as the cost of fizz bottles seemed

      Btw new hostel doesn't seem 'that' boring despite the claustrophobic issue both in the room and the bathroom.
      I kinda hate when toilet and shower gets separated. And it's even terrifying to even think of the height of the door of one of the three toilet stalls. The ground clearance is so wide that someone can crawl into it, or even put a phone through it when someone uses his only chance to answer nature's call.

    <p>Maybe I just need to stop going to classes in rainy days. Can't go wet. This is absurd. Did the collector declare a holiday for us or for the rain?</p>
