  <h1>Politics: A measure of human sanity</h1>
  <p>
    This webpage is to be considered as my political views on 
    events and contexts in and out of the country I reside at. Views can 
    offend, hence discretion is advised.<br>

    Motive: To fulfil the public demand, to just the unjust, to uplift the opressed.

          <h3>Conflict: Russia vs Ukraine</h3>
          <p>
            The views of people on endorsing either of the two sides must not be solid. Faults on either sides rather than siding with a solid opinion is an absolute bullshit opinion.
            Western assumption of being the center of justice is not the real justice, and their manifestation on human rights has never ever been followed by them. Look at their history.<br>

            All about the brass neck of the white reporters of various puppet media groups 
            to keep wiping the stains of blood of Iraqis that got butchered under the Bush regime 
            and the denial of such murder. The same people who assume that the hub of human rights cradle origins from the west, 
            are the same people who covers up those blood stains with "National Security and for the sake of retaliative purposes".
