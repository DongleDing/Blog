          <h3>Conflict: Russia vs Ukraine</h3>
          <p>
            The views of people on endorsing either of the two sides must not be solid. Faults on either sides rather than siding with a solid opinion is an absolute bullshit opinion.
            Western assumption of being the center of justice is not the real justice, and their manifestation on human rights has never ever been followed by them. Look at their history.<br>

            <br>
            My sympathy despite these notions remains to the people who have nothing to do with the war. It's always the people that would have to 
            endure in a country involved in a mass scale armed conflict; actively conducted by the political figureheads for their need and greed.

          <h3>Occupation: Israel upon Palestine</h3>
          <p>
            Palestine of course. If I ever have to receive any sort of hatred for such an opinion, then that would be antisemitism, for 
            being sympathetic towards the oppressed, and not endorsing the apartheid regime fuelled by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States">Feds with billion dollar fundings.</a>
            <br>Let's be clear. For a person with a house and family, it would always be an act of injustice upon him if a guest he welcomed into to his house takes over the house and defenestrates him and his family. And retaliation
            to win back his home is the right thing to do. If being portayed as a terrorist for defending his homeland against the occupiers, then let it be, as the same set of defamation league coons never wanted to see and admit the unwanted bloodshed 
            they did throughout the timeline before and after Nakba.
          </p>
          <p>
            There had been several instances through our timeline when the Western governments wanted to use their veto power of silencing the people who spoke things 
            that hurted them, which is the words that amplified their crimes against humanity. Silence is a great weapon. To annihilate a civilization that lived there for thousands of 
            years before the British Mandate, one just need two simple things: Arms and Silence. To fulfill the Western interests in the middle east, and not the cause of reviving the "Kingdom of God", 
            such weapons of silence, and the power to silence is all they need. For which, the curtain of mainstream-media like BBC, CNN and Fox News and such, shall be used to hide the 24/7 carpet bombings on the schools and 
            hospitals orchestrated by the army of "the chosen ones". Putting full-scale blame by using the word "Hamas" repetitively despite the fact that the great commander of the IDF really intended to wipe out a 
            population which had more than half of it as people below the age of 15, the main-stream media really can root into your mind and force you to blame the ones that endure, and hallow the ones that cause the endurance.

            Too see how the Federal tax dollars sucked from the civilians is used as a fuel for the bloodshed:<br>

          <h3>Invasion: The West upon Iraq</h3>
          <p>
            All about the brass neck of the white reporters of various puppet media groups 
            to keep wiping the stains of blood of Iraqis that got butchered under the Bush regime 
            and the denial of such murder. The same people who assume that the hub of human rights cradle origins from the west, 
            are the same people who covers up those blood stains with "National Security and for the sake of retaliative purposes".
            This does not amplify any sort of prejudice towards the people of west, but to those who orchestrate the 
            hatred in their minds.
