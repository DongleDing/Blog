    <h1>Extroversion: Something that shouldn't be force fed</h1>
    <p>
      As an individual who prefers mild space and a small friend circle, it is 
      indeed a necessity to find a space for an introvert like me to help recharge 
      social battery and go wild once it's filled. And it wasn't that necessary for Aadhila to 
      express her shock when I ushered myself into that wilderness when Shalmali Kholgade took on the stage during Hestia Tech Fest, and when everyone including her went nuts jumping around like if its a concert where Taylor Swift heards her flock of sheep.
      (rip my limb, swifties, I'll wait). All I need is a ukulele, and a Honda Africa Twin. Why? That's the best bike for long haul. Why a ukulele? I don't think any middle class guitarists take their Les Paul or Fenders into the road trip.
      The place I live will never force me to even think of calling it adaptable. Thanks to the disastrous background I was raised in. Now the sheer responsibility of taking risks to break out of this country to the west solely remains on my shoulder, despite having a cousin studying and working in London.
