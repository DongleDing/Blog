    <h1>Cringework: A backfired adoration resume</h1>

    <p>Hi Nejuva （づ￣3￣）づ╭❤️～ To be assiduous with most of the spadework I've been entrusted to fulfil by my belated institution has made me obliterate to consider conveying you my solicit memorandum. And it never has been less predicament and detrimental to me ever since I found out I have a non-vicious benevolent encephalon that seems cognitively aligned enough to comprehend the meaning of the world around me. Life's not fair. Gloom and misery, we tend to have a hefty sentiment of endearment and it never goes initially the way you think. If the universe have doodled your henceforward journey of yours through the pulchritudinous patchwork to live with a person who wanted his bequest to be known for as a man whose amour towards you and the endless twilight lit with the celestial beauty up above our head is something no soul ever had, then you shall proceed to advance with your desire if your confidante has told is literal. I shall give you a brief fact about me. I love Linux and jamming WiFi routers and plunge into the world of pentest and social engineering, and my genesis begins from Alappuzha in November 8th of the year 2003, and I passed out of the senior secondary school the year Gokul passed out. You are now left with a few attributes of mine to get an estimated figure of mine. Hope this would be enough for you to analyse and proceed with the contiguous convention of going steady with.
<br>
And don't grieve because I chose to endorse for a momentary incomprehension. My mind never wants to be in a scenario I never prepared for. And partly due to my schedule. Its indeed a challenge to have a plethora of choices in life. And decision has always been my only trepidation. You shall seek to interact anytime if your virtuous wit is willing to do so.

Ammar :)</p>
