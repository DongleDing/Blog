<h1>Liberalism: The new Cold War munition</h1>
<p>What does it feels like, when you live in a world where people suffer from a disease where they are uncertain about their own identity and sexual orientation,
and get offended when someone describes their feeling of uncertainity about their pronouns? In a world where the fundamental education system is harshly pervaded by
rooting the agendas of absolute freethinking in the mind of young children? </p>
 <p>
  To propogate the concept of indentifying someone outside of a logical convention of classifying humans based on their reproductive capability is an absolute moonshine. 
  Living in a world where half of the new population makes the word 'gender' a word with no meaning, the impact of a psychological crisis to be faced in the coming years is unimaginable.
