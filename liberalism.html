<h1>Liberalism: The new Cold War munition</h1>
<p>What does it feels like, when you live in a world where people suffer from a disease where they are uncertain about their own identity and sexual orientation,
and get offended when someone not in such community describes their feeling of uncertainity to those wokes about their pronouns? In a world where the fundamental education system is harshly pervaded by
rooting the agendas of absolute freethinking in the mind of young children? </p>
 <p>
  To propogate the concept of identifying someone outside of a logical convention of classifying humans based on their reproductive capability is an absolute moonshine. 
  Living in a world where a considerable amount of the new population makes 'gender' a word with no meaning, the impact of a psychological crisis to be faced in the coming years is unimaginable.
  The kind of Liberalism seen in the US is something some youth movements in India wanted to embrace and propogate. LGBT and transgender rights, same-sex marriage, Abortion rights, and other socio progressive movements. Rights to be considered to be given to every human beings on an equal basis would never balance the social system. It had that people that barely made it to the middle class could never flourish with such rights. And hence we have caste reservation. And there still is an issue when people considered to be in the lower caste is analoged to a third-world standard. And to dilute down the existing rights on a certain community would only raise human rights concerns. 
<br>
But sometimes, I had a strong feeling. To constrain the rights of the people who adhere to the woke culture would be advised, despite questions raised from several "worldwide" human rights commission that had its origins in countries where millions in other countries were silenced for fighting for their own fundamental rights, or that because they had something to lose to the invaders. The standards of care and consideration they set on a certain group of people are embraced by the people worldwide, and a group of people who can hate someone that excludes from such standards, are formed. 

Why would it be such a challenge for people to accept that they were born just like every other humans, with innocence and no psychological odds? Despite some people born with physical impairness are also added to the ones that require psychological support, I see no reason to accept the claims of such people who thought should've born as someone else, and would do anything to wipe their birth identity from them. The impact this would have on the disciplines such as sport would be intense. Imagine when someone describes why men are even better at being a woman and then beating them in their own sport category.
