    <h1>Unix Lore: Gallivant towards an Open-Source life</h1>
    <p>It was only because of being with the right group of people while seeking refuge in SAPS Anakkal's St.Benedictine Hostel (from his family's 
    autocratic and conservative lifestyle, that spilled a vague essence of imposing the sharia by not letting him see and absorb Islam by himself), that Ammar was able to receive advocation and support from a bunch of luminaries that included Bitchwas, Vee Eay Adharsh, Muzhalimadhavan, Nebolle (twas just a blessing, stop bitching everyone he's indeed a luminary) and Sameen Chechi. </p>
