    It was only because of being with the right group of people while seeking refuge in SAPS Anakkal's St.Benedictine Hostel (from his family's 
    autocratic and conservative lifestyle, that spilled a vague essence of imposing the the acute traditionalism), that Ammar was able to receive advocation and support from a bunch of luminaries that included Bitchwas, Vee Eay Adharsh, Muzhalimadhavan, Nebolle (twas just a blessing, stop bitching everyone he's indeed a luminary) and Sameen Chechi. To not mention a black dude (who also is a loli manga enthusiaist on his personal sidequest of fulfilling his eyes by being fantabulised staring at the round enormous jubblies of hypothetical computerized characters in the form of some furries) named Akhil Sajan Mathew for being a part of this journey is indeed worth a warcrime. Carnage of a hoard of people in Iraq would be tolerable, but this.</p>
    The first interaction with linux has started on the year 2022, the times when Ammar was none but a person of no job, no life, no college or not even posessing a driving license. A new chapter started with a proprietary Virtual Machine called VMWare, and all Ammar didn't realize was how dumb of a smut he was, when he couldn't do a disc partition and fire up the new partition with some good OS. All he had in his mind was the cringe debian based distro, and he messed that partition by bringing in a trash called ParrotOS. Had he ever had the right amount of knowledge on installing Arch Linux, had he sought enlightenment way before college life.

    It was supposed to be starting with a healthy installation procedure of arch linux. The first mistake the dumb Ammar did was to expect someone not to tell him to read <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide">the damn Documentation of the Arch Linux installation</a> process, as he was simply carried away by the 
    beautiful kawaii gnome and kde desktop ricing of such os he found in r/unixporn. But all the apparently caring connoseiur and advisor Viswas Pole Joknee did was to simply dodge from the main priorities of helping his homies, when he once started to hook up with some ugly girls in EFLU Hyderabad Campus. Letting his advisor to suffer in oblivion, the dumb Ammar realized all he has and needed was himself. So he installed a crappy iso file from the main archlinux website, and fired it up on his VMWare (Took him a huge while to realize VMWare wasn't Kosher since it was proprietary). All herecieved was some bunch of traceback errors that is usually displayed (with arrogance) by Python compilers, when he made some crappy uncertain partition oonfiguration settings initially. All he later realized was that he was supposed to install a bloddy kde enviroment later on to not show the cringe old terminal feeling, when someone uses it.
