    <h1>Unix Lore: Gallivant towards an Open-Source life</h1>
    <p>It was only because of being with the right group of people while seeking refuge in SAPS Anakkal's St.Benedictine Hostel (from his family's 
    autocratic and conservative lifestyle, that spilled a vague essence of imposing the sharia by not letting him see and absorb Islam by himself), that Ammar was able to receive advocation and support from a bunch of luminaries that included Bitchwas, Vee Eay Adharsh, Muzhalimadhavan, Nebolle (twas just a blessing, stop bitching everyone he's indeed a luminary) and Sameen Chechi. To not mention a black dude (who also is a loli manga enthusiaist on his personal sidequest of fulfilling his eyes by being fantabulised staring at the round enormous jubblies of hypothetical computerized characters in the form of some furries) named Akhil Sajan Mathew for being a part of this journey is indeed worth a warcrime. Carnage of a hoarde of people in Iraq would be tolerable, but this.</p>
