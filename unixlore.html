    <h1>Unix Lore: Gallivant towards an Open-Source life</h1>
    <p>It was only because of being with the right group of people while seeking refuge in SAPS Anakkal's St.Benedictine Hostel (from his family's 
    autocratic and conservative lifestyle, that spilled a vague essence of imposing the the acute traditionalism), that Ammar was able to receive advocation and support from a bunch of luminaries that included Bitchwas, Vee Eay Adharsh, Muzhalimadhavan, Nebolle (twas just a blessing, stop bitching everyone he's indeed a luminary) and Sameen Chechi. To not mention a black dude (who also is a loli manga enthusiaist on his personal sidequest of fulfilling his eyes by being fantabulised staring at the round enormous jubblies of hypothetical computerized characters in the form of some furries) named Akhil Sajan Mathew for being a part of this journey is indeed worth a warcrime. Carnage of a hoard of people in Iraq would be tolerable, but this.</p>
    <p>The first interaction with linux has started on the year 2022, the times when Ammar was none but a person of no job, no life, no college or not even posessing a driving license. A new chapter started with a proprietary Virtual Machine called VMWare, and all Ammar didn't realize was how dumb of a smut he was, when he couldn't do a disc partition and fire up the new partition with some good OS. All he had in his mind was the cringe debian based distro, and he messed that partition by bringing in a trash called ParrotOS. Had he ever had the right amount of knowledge on installing Arch Linux, had he sought enlightenment way before college life.</p>
