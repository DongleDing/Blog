      <h1>The Exodus.</h1>
      <h2><i>A Voyage of anguish...</i></h2>
      <p><i>Again, time has marched by, and little Ammar is no more little. Two years into a new chapter without Ms.Shemeera. All just hopes of filling that void
      and going back into the happy times is what was all in his head. And passed by some lone days of despair and hopelessness,
        and days of accepting the fact (in grief) that he is worthless and he would find no friends. All the influence his mother made throughout her life by befriending 
        almost all teachers that taught him and his sister, are all gone like blown ashes. The house which was filled with people in weekends, are now empty like a city after a massive apocalypse.
        Legend has it that the brother of Ms.Shemeera has used his break to gather attention from her friends and expected people to be sentimental and sympathetic towards him, who 
        did absolutely nothing but a deriliction to his family. <br>Added with the daily arrogance filled rebuke Ammar received from his father (to cope with the hassle he received from his office, and to cope with living a life as a widower), and the challenges of living in a house with no mother, and to cope with the tough environment he experienced from his class, 
        where some teachers of his assumed he has nothing to be sad about of his life, as getting back from school to home with no mother is like just a usual home, the heart that once was shaped out of innocence forced to be hard as a rock, as the years passed by.
        The times where only the son gets beaten up by his father, has now turned into a chance of a retaliation. With exchances of punches and kicks, after getting inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">MAD policy</a> inspired by IAEA. No shame, no regrets. The world turned him into someone worse than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">a person who got rejected from the Arts school</a>.</i></p>

      <h2><i>The Outbreak</i></h2>
<p><i>And so did the years passed by, until a time when something unusual was unleashed upon to the world. A Global Pandemic. Would be blunt to side with an opinion that delivers a fact in adequate that there would always be a global Pandemic at every 20th (more likely) year of a century. And the world never was the same. Stories of stratagems about the "Chinese" strategy to acquire the global paramount was everywhere in the news, despite the usual news coverage and live tolls. It really wasn't a challenge enough to adhere the mankind together, despite the amount of efforts taken in various countries to not let people die by it. <br>
Putting things in the perspective of a citizen,life as a whole was seemed to be impacted, though literally a part of it was actually the subjects to impact. A life to rely on that included social contacts which required one or some physical means, was the one that got trenched the hardest.  
But despite having a tough time for most of the people that really had someone to care about, it was a mere of a concern for Ammar, who was used to isolation, a status quo of the "quarantine" era. But despite being much used to it, it was a perk to having acquired a sheer power on the square screens that was a secondary requisite to every humans, (in which case the primary was life indeed, which some classes of humans weren't aware of) when a schooling system that was literally transformed into something that can't be expressed with a solid refined opinion, was introduced to balance the educational system through
the new world,
  <ul>
    
<li>A world where there was a chance for introverts to feel a different form of reality,</li>
<li>A world where masks, sanitizers and social distancing was heavily emphasised, endorsed and critiqued,</li>
<li>A world where <a href="/liberalism.html">a sudden uprise on the psychological approach to glitch a civilization</a> was witnessed,</li>
<li>A world where the messiahs made realize about a world to witness where the youth is not ready for, and </li>
<li>A world that saw an old conventional balance in three years, where some advancements were made.</li> 
  </ul>
    This would also explain why a humanitarian crisis would pave way for new ideas that would bring about a new set of opinions and schools of thoughts and doctrines to hate and love, to glorify and vilify, and for some to use it as a knife upon the world. A hope for the world was seen doomed, and there was nothing much even for the stoics and counter-wokes to do, when the global judiciary balanced on gibberish and injustice has their fate on their hands.
But despite all, though it is pretty obvious about the fact that the world marks its end not by the readvent of the christ and his antonym, but solely by prejudice; the signs of such an end would be the time when the world reaches such an extent where the word "Utopia" would be its synonym, and never, NEVER be just a perspective.
  
<h2>Setbacks and Vindication</h2>
  <p>It was all a time of realization, so long that it was only realization
    and there was no space for an action after a certain realization.
    A revelation, a self-revelation to a side of the world that wasn't much
    known to Ammar, where prairies of comfort was just the cover for a harsh
    reality, also lead him to embrace conjecture, which made him hate the ones
    meant to love, and love the ones meant to hate.
    Yes, a set of people meant to diplay and personify
    his prejudice really did existed, and it probably 
    could even be the one reading this lore. Thoughts clouded by the harsh reality, 
    and having to experience a mere of its extent even in home that never felt much homely, 
    this forced Ammar to seek reliance on the escapism through a plethora of artworks, which 
    was admired by the people only by its beauty, and not by its meaning; a barrier that led him to failure in 
    making people realize that it wasn't solely due to a speck of creativity, but due to the realization of the credibily of using drugs when he considered art 
    as its only alternative. Hinderace to it due to psychological endurance induced by the staffs of <a href="https://saps.ac.in/">the school he leant that time</a>. 
    Despite being enrolled with a cynical approach and then reaching a moment of realization of the rabbit-hole he landed on, the times he had in the St. Benedictine Hostel 
    was that one time which helped him find a hope, a hope that would then give him nothing but influence, dignity, esteem and a speck of enlightenment, all in the form of some individuals some of which Ammar mentioned in <a href="/unixlore.html">the UnixLore</a>, and some people that belonged to a place where more than one <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__.s.e.b.i.n.j.o.s.e.__/">Sebins</a>,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/_.dominic.______/">Dominics</a>,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/de4.in/">Denins</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_raja_.4/">Angelos</a> would never exist in a quintrillion years.
    And that year ended, with nothing but hopes of rebuilding a life so crippled that was tried to be fixed by three therapists who failed to bring his life together. Walking out of St. Benedictine Hostel, all in his mind again was some mixed feelings, and that was due to the austere hospitality displayed by the wardens there, despite being the place that provided good food, and a good place to learn and communicate.
