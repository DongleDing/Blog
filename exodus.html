      <h1>The Exodus.</h1>
      <h2><i>A Voyage of anguish...</i></h2>
      <p>Again, time has marched by, and little Ammar is no more little. Two years into a new chapter without Ms.Shemeera. All just hopes of filling that void
      and going back into the happy times is what was all in his head. And passed by some lone days of despair and hopelessness,
        and days of accepting the fact (in grief) that he is worthless and he would find no friends. All the influence his mother made throughout her life by befriending 
        almost all teachers that taught him and his sister, are all gone like blown ashes. The house which was filled with people in weekends, are now empty like a city after a massive apocalypse.
        Legend has it that the brother of Ms.Shemeera has used his break to gather attention from her friends and expected people to be sentimental and sympathetic towards him, who 
        did absolutely nothing but a deriliction to his family. <br>Added with the daily arrogance filled rebuke Ammar received from his father (to cope with the hassle he received from his office, and to cope with living a life as a widower), and the challenges of living in a house with no mother, and to cope with the tough environment he experienced from his class, 
        where some teachers of his assumed he has nothing to be sad about of his life, as getting back from school to home with no mother is like just a usual home, the heart that once was shaped out of innocence forced to be hard as a rock, as the years passed by.
        The times where only the son gets beaten up by his father, has now turned into a chance of a retaliation. With exchances of punches and kicks, after getting inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">MAD policy</a> inspired by IAEA. No shame, no regrets. The world turned him into someone worse than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">a person who got rejected from the Arts school</a>.

And so did the years passed by, until a time when something unusual was leashed upon to the world. A Global Pandemic. Would be blunt to side with an opinion that delivers a fact in adequate that there would always be a global Pandemic at every 20th (more likely) year of a century. And the world never was the same. Stories of stratagems about the "Chinese" strategy to acquire the global paramount was everywhere in the news, despite the usual news coverage and live tolls. It really wasn't a challenge enough to adhere the mankind together, despite the amount of efforts taken in various countries to not let people die by it. <br>
Putting things in the perspective of a citizen,life as a whole was seemed to be impacted, though literally a part of it was actually the subjects to impact. A life to rely on that included social contacts which required one or some physical means, was the one that got trenched the hardest.
