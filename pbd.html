    <h1>The pale blue dot</h1>
    <p>
      Look again at that dot.<br>
      That's here.<br>
      That's home.<br>
      That's us.<br>
      On it everyone you love,<br>
      everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,<br>
      every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.<br>
      The aggregate of our joy and suffering,<br>
      thousands of confident religions,<br>
      ideologies, and economic doctrines,<br>
      every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,<br>
      every creator and destroyer of civilization,<br> 
      every king and peasant, every young couple in love,<br>
      every mother and father, hopeful child,<br>
      inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals,<br>
      every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,”<br>
      every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there,<br>
      on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br>

      The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.<br> 
      Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one<br>
      corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants<br>
      of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings,<br>
      how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.<br> 
      Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors<br>
      so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters<br>
      of a fraction of a dot. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance,<br>
      the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe,<br>
      are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely <br>
      speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all<br>
      this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere<br>
      to save us from ourselves.<br>

      The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.<br>
      There is nowhere else, at least in the near future,<br>
      to which our species could migrate.<br>
      Visit, yes. Settle, not yet.<br>
      Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.<br>

      It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience.<br>
      There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.<br>
      To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,<br>
      and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.<br>
