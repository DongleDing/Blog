          On dark gloomy days, I found my sunshine in city lights drenched in soft raindrops. Perhaps it was the serenity each raindrop
          held that made me feel this way. And perhaps for a moment, i felt more warmth in the flickering streetlights and headlights than I did 
          with the sun. So on dark gloomy days, I just wanted to hide in the darkness and appreciate the little lit lantern resting right beside my feet.

          Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Dutch</a>.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br>
