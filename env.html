          The ones who see things differently
          <br>
          They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect to the <b>status quo</b><br>
          You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.<br>
          About the only thing you can't do is to ignore them, because they change things, they push the human race forward.<br>
          While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.<br>
          Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world,<br>
          are the ones who do.

          Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Dutch</a>.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br>
