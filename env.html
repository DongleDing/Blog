        <blockquote>Enlightenment is the understanding that this is all, that this is perfect, that this is it. Enlightenment is not an achievement, it is an understanding that there is nothing to achieve, nowhere to go.</blockquote>

          The misfits
          <br>
          The rebels
          <br>
          The troublemakers
          <br>
          The round pegs in the squareholes
          <br>
          The ones who see things differently
          <br>
          They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect to the <b>status quo</b>
          You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.<br>
          About the only thing you can't do is to ignore them, because they change things, they push the human race forward.<br>
          While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.<br>
          Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world,<br>
          are the ones who do.
