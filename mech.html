                <p>
                  As a childhood desire to satisfy the thirst of curiosity that kept me awake most of the time, it was always my desire to know how things really worked. Apart 
                  from finding out how reality works (which I definitely regret), I had a great desire to 'try' to make some mechanisms, and patent it. This subject provides a great 
                  amount of opportunity that supposedly a few can feel; few because their views on future has been clouded with robots and AI, which they only see. But I strongly believe there are some extents in mechanical 
                  engineering that could provide groundbreaking advancements that could greatly help mankind to produce one of the most laziest generations to ever exist. My destiny is to make the best use of the subject, and 
                  find a way to help me and my generation to move forward through a timeline with roads having an infinte amount of deep potholes of despair and hopelessness. My desire is to satisfy my curiosity and my nature of 
                  finding inconsistency in anything, and keep questioning until I find the answer the worth of which is not determined by its distance from accuracy, but by the level of satisfaction I would receive. Long live the petrolheads!

                  About a small project/assignment assigned to us by our faculty teaching Machine Tools and Metrology. The aim was to select any mechanical component, draw and draft it 
                  with proper standards and specifications, fabricating the component using the machines we had in our workshop, and to finally make a project report. The component I decided 
                  to work on was a small spur gear.
