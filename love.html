    <h1>Love and Related Interests</h1>
    <p>Click <a href="/loveresume.html">here</a> for the only billet-doux I've ever written.<br><small> Will add more into here. I am a busy man, it takes time.</small></p>
    <p>Person of interest: A Girl named Nejuva, introduced to me by a cousin of my acquaintance and a handyman who also is my roomate. Named Gokul.
    <br>
    Sadly, sources (the above-said acquaintances) have claimed that the universe wasn't orchestrated to match our trajectories to coincide forever, (or even a bit through the time in person); as a harlequin in the form of my other roomate named Rabbani (a thin, white malabari bloke who never gets annoyed but made me annoyed because >> ) has made up mind to speak to Nejuva in person and edge her from me by his unexpected rizz which was found fascinated by her ( I never found worth as a rizzery, and I wasn't amused by it). <br>The fact that even she gave her number to him and not me when I sent her this letter (via Gokul's cousin) dipped me in thoughts of why an imbecile like him is a subject of her interest, as legend has it that he once made advancements for a coitus with a guy named Joel (who lives next room) in an stagnant woodland nearby.
    Starting off with such a "love"-resume with supercillous vocabulary (in words of my sister Oachi, she never been in love, but claims to be a connoseiur when it comes to female interests in men) that was apparently considered as a rejection letter by Nejuva, this page would explain my calamitous approach to love, and will keep updating it until it stops being so.</p>
