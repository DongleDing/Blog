    <h2>Genesis</h2>
    <hr size="3" width="100%" color="black">
    <p>It all started on a cold rainy day of shabbat 8th day of November, in the year 2003. God said, "Let there be two of them", and then there were two of them. God said, "let one be handsome, and the other be ugly", and then they were handsome, and ugly. Knowing that the handsome would take advantage of all his powers, the ugly one decided to take him out in the womb of Ms. Shemeera Hashim, direct.</p>

<p>And then the ugly one was welcomed to the filthy planet with reluctance by Mr and Mrs. Hashim Yoonus, and named him <b>Ammar Bin Hashim</b>. The handsome twin was then interred next to his beloved grandparents. Life goes on with the previous womb occupier of Ms. Shemeera named Oachi. A "blokette" who now have been trying not to succumb to the detrimental medical college founded by some other bloke named Jaggu Shivarathreeshwara.</p>

<p>The idiot in question at the genesis era. Took him a huge while to realize how the whole world would turn against his face.</p>
<h3>The <i>humble</i> beginnings..</h3>
    <p>Ammar Bin Hashim (2003-2023) has decided to assume the world he lives in as a source of an eternal peace and tranquility, since the day he started to convey conventional and understandable words from his mouth. Despite knowing about his cognitive imparity and ADHD, the hashims decided to send him to one of the <a href="https://iisdammam.edu.sa/"> most pathetic schools ever at that time </a> at the age of 4. Knowing he is not a normal child and possess some real percipiential disorders, the parents considered him as a normal child and proceeded to treat him the way how the parents of other children used to do. Earlier being kicked out from the kindergarten section of another school (Couldn't find their authentic link, what a sham), the parents finally made use of their innocent braincells to realize the worthlessness of having such an autistic son. Sad they couldn't find any way to get rid of him, but the son never even had to worry about it all all, since he was in the happiest phase of his life, not knowing what could happen to him in 10 years would be something he never thought he would go through.</p>
    <p>All this little creep did was to find any means to induce predicaments to his beloved Oachi and to his parents, who had to find some way to make him feel adhered into his world of comfort and hopes, while living in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@26.43927,50.1125236,63m/data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu"> old apartment </a> of the nostalgic Dammam. Remniscents worth of Joy and Tears still live there, and that gave a smile on his face, even after he decided to subverse his rotting life into the detrimental life by getting probed by <a href="https://tkmce.ac.in">the Musaliar's massive and autonomous minarets.</a> despite using the recuperation times that span for about a month every year. The world around little Ammar was filled with Joy and hopes, and at some times couldn't bear the amount of joy he could contain, and jump around the room like a baby goat. A time of influence though infuriated by some of his unwanted intimidating classmates, he chose to seek happiness through curiousity and games on an old HP 32-bit Desktop PC his father bought for him for hopes to prove a point, that his son is not a retard. Stories has it that this child was once considered one of the intelellectually advanced students of their school at that time, alongside the nerd ass turdball <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sahilroshen/">Soil Erection.</a> Couln't blame him, as he was one of the very few students who tried to resurrect him from levigation, in which case the dumb Ammar didn't realize what Soil tried to do was to bring the then motherless Ammar out of the matrix to find happiness, and rejection of Soil's advise along with little Ammar's condescending attitude after seeking attention after Ms. Shemeera's tragic departure from the miserable offsprings she raised for 12-15 years made Ammar lose all of the influence he had. There even was once a time when Soil decided to derail little Ammar for not complying with him.</p>
    <p>The years after somehow flourishing from the preparatory era has led him to see a hope, a hope he once wanted to return to him after 13 years. Things started to go uphill ever since Ms. Shemeera realized that her son with such unendurable cognitive imparity must forget for a while about how lonely of a prick he would really be in the end, and decided to take care of his academic life. It was at this point of his life where he was forced to be convinced discursively by his beloved parents that it is his grades that would define his emotional balance, and thus he believed and complied, like a submissive schmuck.</p> 
    <p>And the time marched through the days, that turned into months, then into years. And so did little Ammar with some delusional hopes of being someone relevant. The long-distant genetic mutuals duly noted his abrupt academic insurrection, decided to find any means by which they could mark an end to it.</p>

<h3>The predicament arc</h3>
<p>The joy and the arbitrary feeling of the "life's best years" really didn't last that long. Though there was a physical and emotional support helpline from Ms.Shemeera, her body did not let her go for it for long time. And it was a challenge for little Ammar to accept the fate that his mother might not live long enough to see him finally fixing his life. The creatine levels kept increasing as the days passed by. And the inconvenience and the unparalleled symbolic expression of not giving a flying fuck which  was expressed by some doctors that includes the clownhead <a href="https://www.pisharodysamajam.com/legend/dr-ramadas-pisharody/"> Dr. Ramdas Pisharody</a> has made the creatine levels spike up and gradually forced Ms.Shemeera to get a new kidney. A bit conveniennce from his side would have helped change the course of little Ammar's history of being the happiest man in the planet. It was all an agreement made with the Donor, that provided a ray of hope. But the fate wasn't the way how little Ammar had in his mind. </p>
<h4><i>The downhill and lone saga</i></h4>
    <p>The usual dialysis of Ms. Shemeera had to proceed till the date of surgery. But still, it was her body that forced it not to happen, so that she could never live again with little Ammar. It was a forced part of life for little Ammar to accept the fate and endurace to live without his best friend, and to live with his uncle whose part of contribution for the inconvenience caused Ms. Shemeera to leave her little Ammar with him, only to give him trauma by living there, So that she could proceed her treatment in India, only to make matters worse.</p>
    <p><i>March 1st, 2016.</i> Little Ammar was on his way out of the exam hall after an easy exam. 6th grade finals. And he met his father outside the school gates, whom he did not expect to see, as little Ammar used to travel on school bus. Being informed that Ms.Shemeera was hospitalized, and not knowing the severity till he met her there in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travancore_Medical_College_Hospital"> hospital</a> after a long haul from Dammam to Trivandrum. it was one of a few scenes little Ammar wanted to wipe from his memory, where he saw his unconscious mother benumbed in the ICU, strapped on a bed with ventilators and medical monitors nearby. Once he was convinced it was a Cardiac arrest, it wasn't an easy thing for little Ammar to accept the fate his mother had to be at, and sat down on the corridor outside the intensive care unit, and wept helplessly. Despite efforts from the pseudo relatives nearby to consolidate him, they still weren't able to get that scene out of his mind. It was then a moment of decision between the relatives, and it was all about whether to cease her life support or not. Despite the outrage and opinion from little Ammar regarding the need for such a discussion, the relatives kept thinking as the doctor estimated her days that can be counted, and her chances of a mere recuperation. And it was just hopes and prayers that remained to maintain both his and Mr. Hashim's sanity. The relatives were the part that existed as her hinderance for the apparent covalescing days. Numerous deceitfulness from the crackheads that included <a href="https://instagram.com/najumudeenahammed?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="> the own brother of Ms. Shemeera</a> (the uncle of little Ammar with whom he stayed with when Ms. Shemeera had to get hospitalized) and her uncles caused the relatives and friends to part ways with the Hashim Family, leaving behind no one but the 12 year old whose biggest objective then was to bring his mother back to his life. The part of speculations from <a href="https://instagram.com/_yoonscheeks_?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">the moronic demon in the form of a fat smut</a>, a.k.a the cousin with less contact did her part in convincing the tuition teacher of Ammar that the real reason Ms.Shemeera had to succumb to her oblivion was only because of the usual altercations between him and his sister, which is true from a perspective. But it's all about the "perspective" in question that one needs to talk about. A pureblood who decided to spend her submissive life doing her best part to slowly let the putrescence gobble the woman who mothered Ms.Shemeera (who also played a part in ostracizing the mother of little Ammar by her mere bewilderment, which she hides with her age so people can fill their hearts with sympathy when some teardrops are displayed).</p>
<h2>The blanked out saga.</h2>
<p>A year without Ms.Shemeera was passed by, and despite all the ignorance from the friends and teachers of little Ammar,he still hoped that one day he would get back with her. </p>
