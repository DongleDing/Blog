    <h2>Genesis</h2>
    <p>It all started on a cold rainy day of November, in the year 2003. God said, "Let there be two of them", and then there was two of them. God said, "let one be handsome, and the other be ugly", and then they were handsome, and ugly. Knowing that the handsome would take advantage of all my powers, I decided to take him out in the womb, direct. </p>
