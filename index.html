    <h1>Welcome to my website. Get traumatized (≖ᴗ≖ ✿)</h1>
    <small>The website is currently under serious construction and will be frequently updated till further notice. Some links would disappoint you by not opening up in the way you anticipate. And I am indeed aware of it, and that's exactly my concern right now.</small>

    <p><i>(Made by some idiot named Ammar. And yes, this webpage needs some serious work.</i></p>
    <p><i><small>Though it does adhere to the faction endorsed and continues to propogate ideologies of <a href="https://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website.</a></small></i></p>
    <p><i>In the name of <a href="https://stallman.org">the father</a>, the son (me indeed), and the holy GNU/Linux...</i></p>
    <p><i>I adhere, endorse and propogate the idea and legacy of the beloved individual <a href="https://dawayanadhornet.codeberg.page/#lore"> Viswas Pole Joknee. </a> All my works are not a speck of the mimick of his creativity, and I do admit the fact that he is one of a very few people willing to save me anytime I plan for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"> Dinner Reservation.</a> And this is my chance to express my acknowledgement and gratitude towards this entity who made me who I am today.

    <p>It all started on a cold rainy day of shabbat 8th day of November, in the year 2003. God said, "Let there be two of them", and then there were two of them. God said, "let one be handsome, and the other be ugly", and then they were handsome, and ugly. <a href="/genesis.html">Read more...</a></p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashim.yoonus/">old man</a> leaves me no signs of semblence for peace. Maybe I'd have to fight for it, risking my i5 laptop.</p>

    <p>See my art here. I used to post them <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lordabh/">here</a>.

    <h2>Touching Grass Pics</h2>
  </div>
    <p>This is a phrase used most often to trigger people who play Genshin Impact and Valorant. But for some reason, I've been asked by my acquaintances to go touch grass. So I decided to present a photo album of me touching literal grass. Let's be clear about one thing: I don't play Genshin Impact. Valorant, yes. But not anymore. <a href="/grasspics.html">Look here</a></p>

<div class = "otherpics" id="otherpics">
<h2>Other Pictures (Photography)</h2>
</div>
<p>An attempt to display a passion which I don't consider as my part of creativity are shown <a href="/pics.html">here</a>. Often it can be considered this way, where pictures convey more than sentences, and that becomes what I call as beauty.</p>
