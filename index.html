    <h1>Welcome to my website. Get traumatized</h1>
    <p><i>In the name of <a href="https://stallman.org">the father</a>, the son (me indeed), and the holy GNU/Linux...</i></p>
    <p><i>I adhere, endorse and propogate the idea and legacy of the beloved individual <a href="https://dawayanadhornet.codeberg.page/#lore"> Viswas Pole Joknee. </a> All my works are not a speck of the mimick of his creativity, and I do admit the fact that he is one of a very few people willing to save my ass anytime I plan for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia"> Dinner Reservation.</a> And this is my chance to express my acknowledgement and gratitude towards this entity who made me who I am today. Props to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/va_adharsh/"> V(eetile per) A(cchante Per) Adharsh.</a> too.</i></p>

    <p>It all started on a cold rainy day of shabbat 8th day of November, in the year 2003. God said, "Let there be two of them", and then there were two of them. God said, "let one be handsome, and the other be ugly", and then they were handsome, and ugly. <a href="/genesis.html">Read more...</a></p>

    <p>Maybe you should consider visiting <a href="/blog.html">this website</a>. Sad I made you feel apparently gutted. Your votive is indeed counted.</p>

    <p>Bruh. I am on the influence of the apparent ecstasy I rely on to seek peak amenity. So it really may take a while for me to keep updating this part here. You still think I'm done with the genesis lore, you dumb bitch?</p>
 <div class="songs" id="songs">
   <h2>Earworm Symphonies</h2>
   <p>Not all that includes <a href="/songs.html">here</a> are are earworms, some are just so beautiful that no one can even pull me away from it. </p>

    <p>See my art here. I used to post them <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lordabh/">here</a>. But now, I'll let someone do the explanations for the meanings hidden behind my drawings (Oh cmon who the fuck cares about it anyway, maybe a few. But still.. ) or I'll do it myself. You can go <a href="/cringework.html">here</a> to read more about it.</p>
