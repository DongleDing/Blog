    <h2>Genesis</h2>
    <hr size="3" width="100%" color="black">
    <p>It all started on a cold rainy day of shabbat 8th day of November, in the year 2003. God said, "Let there be two of them", and then there were two of them. God said, "let one be handsome, and the other be ugly", and then they were handsome, and ugly. Knowing that the handsome would take advantage of all his powers, the ugly one decided to take him out in the womb of Ms. Shemeera Hashim, direct.</p>

<p>And then the ugly one was welcomed witn reluctance by Mr and Mrs. Hashim Yoonus, and named him <b>Ammar Bin Hashim</b>. The arcs through all his personlalities are exhibited here.</p>
